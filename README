I wrote this .msh file parser out of desire to have a very simple
C interface into the .msh ASCII file format as described here:

http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/doc/texinfo/#MSH-ASCII-file-format


The reader is written with flex and bison and recognizes all
established elements produced by the GMSH software.


This is a work in progress, updated as my needs require them.
